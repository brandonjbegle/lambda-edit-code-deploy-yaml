# Edit Appspec.yaml Lambda Function For AWS CodePipeline

Simple python script (Python 3.6 Runtime) that allows for changing the AppSpec.yaml on the fly in case of different configurations for production and development.

## How does it work?

- Copy this code to a lambda function in your AWS account
- Modify the line that says ‘    destination: XXXXXX’ to match where your code needs to deploy to.
- Modify the index of the array to match your AppSpec.yaml line. Mine was line 5, thus data[4].
- Make modifications/remove the script editing portions of the file. This function modifies some shell scripts that were in the application folder based on production/development.
- Make sure your lambda function has a role that gives it access to the S3 bucket where your input artifact will be stored and CodePipelines so it can update the status to failure or success.
